FooSync
=======

FooSync is a filesystem directory synchronizer. It's specifically designed to
support a repository shared by multiple computers. This repository can be used
as a backup and/or to keep multiple computers synchronized.

It's written in C#/.NET, and designed as a console app and GUI app.
The console version is designed to work in Linux with the Mono runtime, as well
as Windows with the .NET runtime.
The GUI version only works under Windows, as WPF is not supported by Mono.

Status
------

FooSync is in the very early stages of development. It doesn't work yet. :)

The WPF GUI has not been started yet.
